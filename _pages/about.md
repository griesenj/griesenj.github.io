My name is Jon Griesen, and I am currently a graduate student at Grand Valley State University pursuing a master's in Applied Computer Science.

I originally studied Finance at Michigan State University, graduating with my bachelor's degree and a minor in Information Technology in 2016. After approximately four years of professional experience within the financial services arena, I felt there was a creative itch that was left unsatisfied in my prior role. After considerable soul searching and exploration of my options, I ultimately decided to change direction and dive back into school to study computer science. This decision came after falling in love with some introductory computer science coursework at MSU, alongside several online learning resources available on Udemy and other platforms.

Since transitioning back to life as a full time student, I have continued picking up as many new technologies as possible alongside my formal graduate coursework. I fully admit that I still have a lot to learn, but a certain amount of that comes with the territory of a dynamic field such as software development. Despite being frequently humbled by the process, I have greatly enjoyed the journey so far!

Aside from programming, I also enjoy playing instruments (guitar and piano), creating music, disc golf, weightlifting, video games, and spending as much time with friends as possible.
