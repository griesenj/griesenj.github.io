## Overview

This project was one of my first forays into Java for the purpose of developing a fully-fledged piece of software. The motivation for this project was the need to apply one of several possible design patterns discussed during my graduate class to an area of personal interest. I felt that it would be interesting to explore the creation of an item tracker for a "randomizer" of a favorite game of mine, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. In such a randomizer, in-game locations of items are switched around, resulting in a need for an item-tracking utility. After reviewing several possible approaches to the problem, I settled on the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern and implemented a solution using Java and the Swing GUI framework.

For more details on the implementation process, please feel free to view the presentation video linked below in the project gallery. A demonstration of the functionality of the finished product is also included in the form of an animated GIF.

## Technologies

* Java
* Swing
* Eclipse IDE

## Outcomes

This project was a great learning experience and helped set me on the path of considering an appropriate design pattern for a given problem from project onset. Naturally, this is a consideration that is best addressed early on in the development cycle in an effort to reduce duplication of efforts. The item tracking tool itself has also been quite useful for Zelda randomizers!
