## Overview

Disc Golf GDX is the name of an ongoing project of mine that has continued to evolve since its inception in the spring of 2021. I started working on this project after running the idea by my graduate professor (who was teaching me both Requirements Specification and Software Testing at the time) and determining that my proposal would serve as a good basis for the final projects of both of the referenced classes. The <a href="/assets/misc/dggdxWriteup.pdf" target="_blank">detailed writeup referenced in this PDF</a> cover many of my design decisions pertaining to this project, as well as an extensive list of requirements and software tests that have helped guide and enhance the ongoing development of the game. The core gameplay elements are also covered in detail, so be sure to check it out!

While the core focus on this project was additional Java coding experience and inital exposure to a game development framework (LibGDX), I have also greatly enjoyed several other aspects of game design process such as graphic design (sprite creation) and audio engineering (sound effects). Integrating both of these elements with the actual programming of game mechanics has been a fun endeavor so far.

I hope to ultimately arrive at a polished game packaged as an executable JAR for ease of distribution. Peer feedback and general player testing at this juncture would likely determine whether I make further refinements or leave the project "as-is" for the foreseeable future.

## Technologies

* Java
* LibGDX Framework
* IntelliJ IDEA

## Outcomes

I am pleased with the progress made so far, but there is a long way to go before the game reaches a state where I would be comfortable releasing a version for even early play testing. As the project progresses I will look to update this writeup.
