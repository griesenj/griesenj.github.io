## Overview

Paced is a project that stemmed from a graduate-level mobile application development class I took over the summer, ultimately serving as my final project deliverable for the course. The project executes Javascript code via React Native to produce an elegant splits timer dedicated to the concept of "speedrunning" a video game.

When speedrunning a given video game, the goal is generally the completion a game (or a subset thereof) as quickly as possible given a predetermined set of constraints. To track improvement over time it is advantageous for the player to use a tool to monitor the successful completion of various segments. These segments can then be compared to previous bests and provide an ongoing benchmark from which to assess the quality of a given speedrun.

A desktop application known as LiveSplit exists that accomplishes many of these tasks, but I found comparable offerings within the mobile space lacking in terms of features and ease of use. This gap served as the impetus for Paced, which strives to be a elegant mobile splits offering for casual and experienced speedrunners alike.
