## Overview

This project was largely an exercise in real-time team collaboration as a part of my Systems Analysis & Design graduate course. Our team consisted of four members and included multiple developers currently working in the field. Weekly meetings were held to dictate deliverable progress over the course of the semester. A software requirements specification (SRS) document was also created to outline core project requirements and trace various development artifacts such as structural and functional models. These artifacts conformed to the UML standard.

In terms of actual project development, we set out to develop a clone of the popular arcade game "Pac-Man" with a fun twist in the form of various "meme" sprites and characters. Rather than utilize an existing video game framework, we elected to use Swing components as a basis for the project and build out our own versions of necessary game features such as game maps, enemy AI, and collision detection. This was a challenge, but overall served as a great learning opportunity for all team members.

## Technologies

* Java
* Swing GUI
* Eclipse IDE
* IntelliJ IDEA

## Outcomes

While the completed game only consists of a single level, there are many useful features that were implemented that could easily be scaled into a fully-fledged version of the game. In particular, it would be interesting to expand upon the existing enemy AI behavior such that subsequent levels would scale the difficulty appropriately as the player progresses. This in turn would require some revisions to the existing scoring system.
