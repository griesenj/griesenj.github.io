<h3>Meme-Man</h3>
Meme-Man is a Java based group project for the GVSU systems analysis and design graduate course. The concept is a spiritual successor to the original Pac-Man arcade game with a modern twist in the form of relevant memes. While the primary emphasis of the project is a minimum viable product that incorporates important systems analysis and design principles, our group has also focused on generating a high-quality finished project that challenges our existing level of Java understanding. Using the Swing GUI toolkit and the Java platform, we are actively attempting to deliver on the initial requirements established during our planning phases. The goal is a fully functional product that delivers on the base premise of the original Pac-Man game. Throughout the course of development, we have also focused on key concepts such as project management, requirements specification, structural modeling, behavioral modeling, and design. Our hope is that these tools will result in a more robust final product.
